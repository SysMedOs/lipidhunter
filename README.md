https://github.com/SysMedOs/lipidhunter/releases


### Please read the following instructions before you start to run LipidHunter. ###

## Instructions ##

### Windows version ###

* The binary executable version of LipidHunter 2 is provided for Windows users. (Windows 7, 8, and 10, 64bit system required)

    + [`.exe` and `.zip` installation file](https://github.com/SysMedOs/lipidhunter/releases/latest)
 
### How to install LipidHunter 2 from source code ###
* Download the LipidHunter 2 as zip file for your system
    + Please use the source code page in the release page https://github.com/SysMedOs/lipidhunter/releases/
    + Download LipidHunter source Code as .zip. Please notice the date and version of LipidHunter source code.
    + Professional users can use `git` to clone the whole repository, please make sure that you switched to the correct branch.
    + Only the released version is recommended for real data processing. Other development branches may lead to unknown issues and miss interpretation of the data.

* Rename the downloaded file to `LipidHunter.zip`
* Unzip `LipidHunter.zip` file to any folder.
* Downloaded LipidHunter test spectra files: [LipidHunter_Test_mzML_File](https://github.com/SysMedOs/lipidhunter/releases/download/LipidHunter2_RC/TestData.zip)

* Python environment

    + LipidHunter 2 is developed under python 3.7, the current version can still run on python 2.7 (not recommended).
    + The best way is to use virtual environment such as `conda`
    + The requirements is listed in conda_env_{OS}.yml for `conda` users and [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for `pip` users.
        - conda: run `conda env create -f conda_env.yml` you will get an environment named `envlipidhunter` 
        - pip: activate your virtual environment, then `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    + Main dependencies are:
        - Data processing: numpy, pandas, scipy, numba, natsort
        - mzML reader: pymzml
        - Image plot: matplotlib, plotly(required by pymzml)
        - Excel output: openpyxl, xlrd, xlwt
        - Graphic interface: pyside2
    + Test source code installation:
        - LipidHunter 2 is configured to use [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.com) with `py.test` to test on Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
        - Use command `pytest` in LipidHunter folder to run all tests.
        - Optionally, you can test individual unit test in the `test` folder
